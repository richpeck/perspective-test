      ## To do this, we take the raw distance to the point and convert it into decimal format ##

    ## Angle â†’ Screen ##

    ## Works similarly to the racasting technique (IE angle at which point appears is translated into screen X co-ordinate) ##
    def angle_to_screen angle 

      ## Screen Size ##
      ## This determines the number of vertical columns for our screen width vs the FOV angle ##
      column_width = BOUNDING_X / @player.fov_angle # Splits up the screen width into chunks based on FOV (for example, if I have 60 degree FOV and the screen width is 500, each vertical column is worth about 8.3 pixels)
      
      ## Position ##
      ## Take the provided angle and ensure that we are able to allocate it to the correct column (our "x" co-ordinate)
      column = angle + (@player.fov_angle / 2) ## (this normalizes the screen columns from being (-(fov_angle/2) - 0 - (fov_angle)) to (0 - fov_angle)). the reason for this is to simplify the maths

      ## Co-Ordinate ##
      ## The "X" co-ordinate for the point should then be the column width multiplied by the column number (EG 8.33 * 15) ##
      return (column_width * column) + BOUNDING_X ## BOUNDING_X added to provide to offset worldview
